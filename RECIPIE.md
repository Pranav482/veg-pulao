1. Begin by rinsing 1.5 cups basmati rice in water until it runs clear of starch. Next, soak the rice in enough water for 30 minutes.
2. After 30 minutes strain the rice of all the water and keep aside.
3. While the rice is soaking, prep the veggies. Rinse and chop them. Make sure to chop the vegetables in small cubes. For cauliflower, chop them in medium-sized florets. Peel, rinse and slice 1 large onion thinly.
4. Keep all the whole spices aside. From the below list of spices, you can skip black pepper, black cardamom, star anise and mace.
5. Add chopped ginger (1 to 1.5 inches), garlic (4 to 5 small to medium garlic cloves, peeled) and 1 to 2 green chilies (green peppers) in a mortar-pestle.
6. Crush to a paste. You can also use a small grinder for crushing these. Add a bit of water if required while grinding in a small grinder or mixer.
7. Heat 3 tablespoons ghee or oil in a deep thick bottomed pot or pan.
8. Once the ghee has melted and become hot, add all whole spices and fry for a few seconds until they become fragrant. The spices will also splutter while frying. The ghee should not smoke or become too hot.
9. Add 1 cup of thinly sliced onions.
10. Mix the onions with the ghee and begin to sauté them.
11. Stir the onions on a low to medium-low flame. First, the onions will become light golden. Stirring often continue to sauté.
12. Sauté onions until golden.
13. Once the onions become golden, add crushed ginger + garlic + green chili (chili pepper) paste.
14. Stir and sauté for some seconds until the raw aroma of the ginger & garlic goes away.
15. Add ½ cup chopped tomatoes.
16. Mix and sauté for 2 to 3 minutes on a low flame.
17. Now add all the chopped veggies. You will need about 1 to 1.5 cups of mixed chopped vegetables.
18. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons of chopped coriander leaves (cilantro). At this step, you can also add 2 tablespoons of chopped mint leaves.
19. Mix and sauté again for 2 to 3 minutes on a low flame.
20. Add the rice.
21. Mix rice gently with the rest of the ingredients.
22. Sauté rice gently for 1 to 2 minutes on a low to medium-low flame, so that the rice gets well coated with the oil or ghee.
23. Pour 2.5 to 3 cups water into the pan. I added 3 cups of water. Depending on the quality of rice you have used, you can add less or more water. You can replace water with vegetable stock.
24. Add ¼ teaspoon lemon juice.
25. Season with salt. Mix very well. To figure out if you have added the right amount of salt, check the taste of the water. You should feel some saltiness in the water. This means the amount of salt added is right. If the water does not feel salty, then you need to add some more salt.
26. Stir and tightly cover the pot or pan with its lid.
27. Cover and cook the rice until all the water is absorbed. Cook on a low to medium flame. Usually, in the beginning, I cook on a medium-low or medium flame and then halfway through, I lower the flame. Check a few times during cooking to ensure there is enough water. Depending on the quality of rice, you may need to add more water. With a fork, you can also gently stir the rice without breaking the rice grains.
28. Once the rice grains are cooked, fluff them and let the rice stand for 5 minutes covered with the lid.
29. pulao is done and ready to be served
30. You can serve pulao garnished with coriander leaves (cilantro), mint leaves or fried onions and fried cashews or fried raisins.
